Steps to add data to Database

Prereqs:
1. have db running on vagrant (check with vagrant status)
2. untar dataImport.tar from Google Drive
3. run the below commands inside the dataImport folder

Steps: Create Table1
1. type "mysql -u unixadmin -p -h '192.168.50.3" into terminal
2. type the password "unixadmin"
3. type "use UnixTestDB;"
4. type "source createTable.txt;"

Steps: Add data to Table1
1. exit MySQL if open (run this in terminal)
2. type "chmod 700 importDataMySQL.sh"
3. type "./importDataMySQL.sh"
4. Done!

Steps: Check make sure it works
1. type "mysql -u unixadmin -p -h '192.168.50.3" into terminal
2. type the password "unixadmin"
3. type "use UnixTestDB;"
4. type "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Table1;" This shows you have many rows are in Table1.

Final Note:
If you want to add more data (extend the data from ~2.5 million to ~3 million) just run "./importDataMySQL.sh" twice. Now we can simulate 10 million rows easily! Good job Martin creating the data
